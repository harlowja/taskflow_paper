\begin{abstract}

Scalability and reliability in distributed systems is a \emph{hard problem}.
\href{http://docs.openstack.org/developer/taskflow/}{TaskFlow} provides
a framework for implementing workflows with specific provisions for scalability
and reliability. Using taskflow, cue, cinder, glance, octavia, magnum,
mirantis pumphouse, rackspace cloud big data, and other projects inside (and
outside) of \href{http://www.openstack.org/}{OpenStack} are tackling issues of
scalability and reliability in a consistent and unified way. By exploring
the concepts taskflow is based on we will show how it was designed, its
components and how it helps make building cloud platforms (and cloud
applications) that much easier to \emph{just get right}.
